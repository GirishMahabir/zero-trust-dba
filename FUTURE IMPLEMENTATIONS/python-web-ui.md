### Overview of the Solution
1. **ProxySQL Configuration**: Configure ProxySQL to identify and reroute critical SQL commands to a Python application acting as a MySQL server. This routing is based on matching query patterns you define as critical.
2. **Python Application**: Develop a Python application that listens for incoming SQL commands from ProxySQL. Instead of executing these commands, the application stores them and makes them available via a web UI.
3. **Web UI**: The web UI displays the queued commands to super admins, with options to approve, reject, or drop each command. Each command is represented as a row with corresponding action buttons.
4. **Execution Control**: Once a command is approved through the web UI, the Python application then executes the command on the actual MySQL database. If a command is rejected or dropped, it’s removed from the queue without execution.

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Configure ProxySQL
- Use ProxySQL’s query rules to identify critical commands and reroute them to your Python application. This involves setting up a new MySQL server entry in ProxySQL configuration, pointing to your Python application.

#### Step 2: Develop the Python Application
- **MySQL Server Emulation**: Implement a simple MySQL server emulation using libraries like `PyMySQL` or `MySQL-connector-python` to accept connections and queries from ProxySQL.
- **Command Queueing**: On receiving a query, instead of executing it, store it in a queue, which could be a database or an in-memory data structure, along with metadata such as the submitter's information, timestamp, and the query itself.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a web interface that interacts with this queue, displaying pending commands for approval or rejection. This could be achieved with web frameworks like Flask or Django.

#### Step 3: Super Admin Interface
- Implement authentication for super admins to access the web UI.
- Display the queued commands with options to approve, reject, or drop.
- Implement the backend logic to handle these actions. For approved commands, ensure secure and correct execution on the MySQL database. For rejected or dropped commands, remove them from the queue.

#### Step 4: Security and Audit Trails
- **Secure Communication**: Ensure that the communication between ProxySQL, the Python application, and the MySQL database is secure, using encrypted connections.
- **Audit Trails**: Log all actions taken through the web UI, including command approvals, rejections, and the identities of the admins taking these actions.

#### Step 5: Testing and Deployment
- Thoroughly test the system with non-destructive commands to ensure that the routing, queueing, and approval processes work as expected.
- Implement monitoring and alerting for the system to quickly identify and resolve any operational issues.
